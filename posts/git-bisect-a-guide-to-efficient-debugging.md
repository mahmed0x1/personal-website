## ðŸ“Œ Background

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a very powerful version control system that is widely used in the realm of software development. It is designed to track changes in code, enabling collaboration, history tracking, and efficient management of software development projects. Bugs are inevitable companions in the process of software enginnering and resolving them can be a very troublesome, and time-consuming process. However, git boasts a powerful command that can aid developers in tracing elusive bugs within their code. This article delves into the mechanics of [Git Bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect), explaining its functionality and how it serves as a handy tool for bug hunting.

## ðŸ“Œ Understanding Git Bisect

[Git Bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) stands as a powerful feature within the Git version control system. It is designed specifically to pinpoint the commit where a bug was introduced. This command employs a [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), iteratively navigating through commit history to isolate the exact moment when the bug first emerged.

The Git Bisect process involves marking a specific commit as "good" (bug-free) and another as "bad" (bug-introducing), allowing Git to traverse the commit history to specifically locate the problematic commit.

## ðŸ“Œ Step-by-Step Guide

Git bisect uses few subcommands that helps tracking the search process.

```sh
$ git bisect start
```

The above command initiates the git bisect bug searching process.

Now if we run the following command, it means that the current version of the code (active commit) is containing the bug that we do not yet know where it was first introduced:

```sh
$ git bisect bad
```

We can also run the command:

```sh
$ git bisect bad <commit>
```

where you can replace <commit> with the hash of the commit that contains the bug.

After that, you can run:

```sh
$ git bisect good <commit>
```

replacing <commit> with the hash of a commit that is bug-free.

Once we have identified both a bad and a good commit, git bisect selects a commit in the middle of that range of history, checks it out, and outputs something similar to the following:

```sh
Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)
```

here the revision number means the number of commits that fall between the range of the good and bad commit, and the number of steps means the checks that we need to do in order to identify the buggy commit using binary search algorithm.

After that what we need to do is compile the code and check whether the commit selected by git bisect is a good or bad one. If we know the version is good then we can run:

```sh
$ git bisect good
```

Otherwise, if the version is broken we can run:

```sh
$ git bisect bad
```

and then git bisect will output something like:

```sh
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
```

We can keep repeating the process, compile the code, and mark commits as good or bad accordingly, until we have no revisions left to make.

After we identify the buggy commit, we can run:

```sh
$ git bisect reset
```

which will clean up the bisection state and return to the original HEAD before starting the bisection process. If we wish to rest to another commit, presumably the one that does not introduce the bug we found, we can run:

```sh
$ git bisect reset <commit>
```

replacing <commit> with the commit we want to check out.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

Git Bisect is a powerful tool that can aid developers in finding sneaky bugs in their code. It searches through the history of changes and points directly to where a bug first showed up. By using Git Bisect, developers can quickly figure out which part of their code needs fixing, making their projects stronger and more reliable. Mastering Git Bisect means finding and fixing bugs faster, making software better for everyone.
